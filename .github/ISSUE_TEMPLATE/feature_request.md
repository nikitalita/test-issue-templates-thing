**Resource Type**
If this is a request to add conversion for a resource type, describe it here. (e.g. ADPCM Samples, Atlas Textures, etc.)

We will likely not add support for custom resource types that are provided by custom modules. An exception may be made if they are very popular. If you think your custom resource qualifies, make your case below. In either case, Pull Requests that add this are always welcome.
